It basically just show the teams ranked by how often they blitz though. I think that it is fine the way they use it, because it does appropriately show when players do things that are unexpected compared to a traditional defensive look. Essentially the model learned what a standard 4 man rush or blitz looks like and anything else is throwing the model off. MSE reflects that error.\n",

    "* Explanation of their model\n",
    "    * They first made a model for Continuous Pocket Pressure. Essentually predicting pressure at each frame scaled to 0-1\n",
    "    * Then they made a metric for the OL/DL which is basically the rate of that pressure\n",
    "    * Then they did Surplus analysis as an on/off split for each defensive lineman\n",
    "* I do not really like their approach for the surplus analysis in particular bothers me because I don't like on/off splits in football. There are so many confounding factors in the NFL that using pure on/off is garbage.\n",
    "* Alright, for their first model, I do like it. I also think it's dope that they cited another sports paper from 2018 when discussing their inspiration for this model.\n",
    "* The CPP model is similar to the Japanese Couple with more afterwards. Its a player impact distribution and they get a controlling factor for each area of the field by taking the sum of the teams influence at that spot - the other teams' influence. Neat stuff.\n",
    "    * Honestly, just from that alone, they probably deserved to have won. That is a pretty dope concept, solid data science, hadn't been done in Football yet. Good stuff, even if they were heavily inspired by another paper from soccer.\n",
    "* Their CPP is so cool. Doing a total influence for each set of coordinates and then multiplying it by the QB bivariate normal distribution, then dividing that by the standard QB distro to get a scaled pressure percentage on the QB accounting for total influence of both the trenches is __SUCH__ a cool concept. Fuck man. Its so frustrating how good that idea is.\n",
    "* After all that praise, I gotta trach their choice of proving it's worth a damn. Completion % is not a great choice for determining if the OL did a great job (WR drops anyone?), and also they chose to bin the results in buckets of 0.2 without accounting for the relative size of each bucket. How many plays were in each bucket, it's not hard to have a high average completion percentage when there are only 10 plays in the sample. Also, like mentioned in other submission's notes, defenses respond differently for down and distance. So comp % is especially poor when its 3rd and 15 for example.\n",
    "* I think that their second example is better with hurries, hits, and sacks compared to CPP, but still I don't love the binned approach.\n",
    "* Multiple submissions have used the term \"right-censored\". Interesting to note. Basically it means that the result of the play hasn't occured by the end of the sample time. (A pressure would occur eventually, but the play ended already)\n",
    "* \"Kaplan-Meier estimator\" Fuck these kids. \n",
    "    * To be fair, it's basically just a cumulative average to my understanding\n",
    "* They used Simpson's Integration to get the area under a curve, like it's complicated to have a computer do integration or something.\n",
    "* They definitely get away with putting lots of words on their plots explaining shit. \n",
    "* So when ranking the DL, they choose to only filter to 4 man rushes, noting how there are so many factors at play. Yet earlier, they though to just use comp %. I'm getting overly salty.\n",
    "* Again, they choose to use only 4 man rushes, but are doing an On/Off analysis in the NFL with no regard to when these players are being given a breather. You are also giving them MORE credit for taking more plays off by multiplying by time spent on the sideline. Yeah, I guess it points to overall effectiveness, but I don't love that.\n",
    "* Also doesn't avoid confounders like players coming on and off together. The fact that of the top 10, 5 players come from 2 teams, might point to something. Was it really Suh causing havoc, or was it Shaq Barrett and he happened to play similar snaps to Barrett?\n",
    "* Burn it down, Jerry Tillery is top 3 in this metric. Malik McDowell is above Aaron Fucking Donald. Nope, not having it.\n",
    "* Did not mention any limitations of their model, and given my complaints above, I don't think they know football all that well. Yes, this was easily the most impressive concept attempted for the BDB, and they rightfully deserved to have won, but they should've stopped when they were ahead. Almost everything they did outside of the CPP wasn't really that good and had more complaints than praise for."

    "* They use Average OLE in different facets to prove that their model has value. I'm not sure you aren't just double counting stuff here. Of course the OLE is going to be worse on a play that ended in a sack. You basically just measured if the OL gets beat.\n",
    "* I disagree with their approach of doing it as a ratio of Time clean/Time to Throw. Again, they talk about it after the fact as a point of \"The longer the QB has to throw the higher the OLE, so it works\" and that's not what you are measuring. A QB throwing it in 1.5s and a QB sitting back there for 3s are very different, but so long as you don't break the curve before the throw, both are graded out as 100%.\n",
    "* Really not sure that there is enough of a difference between man and zone coverage affecting the rush to justify that being your split. I know that being in man vs zone can affect the kinds of coverage you can play, and teams marry the rush and coverage, but I don't think that should've been a variable to split on and show differences in.\n",
    "* They double down on it by showing it vs every kind of coverage. I really don't know that is relevant. You are also glossing over the details that come up like when teams call certain kinds of coverage. Teams usually blitz and or play man more on 3rd down, and depending on the situation the offense might be doing other options to mitigate what a defense might be trying to do. Defenses adjust how aggresive their DL is based on down and distance so I'm just not convinced that is the approach to facet on.\n",

The point is that for an xgboost model, they state that it isn't properly catching the relationship between the players on the field because it doesn't matter what order they show up in. I disagree a little bit. Yes, it probably doesn't catch the direct relationships very well, I don't know how much permutation invariance has to do with it, but it likely does catch some important variables given everyone's success using XGBoost on nfl data. I agree that a graph is MUCH better at catching information about direct relationships between nodes.\n",

    "* Usually very **_pretty data viz_**. People are suckers for things that look pretty\n",
    "* For the coaching side, it really seems like coaching applicability is the main key. It doesn't have to be complicated data science, just applicable and knowledgable about the game\n",
    "* There is a pretty similar format for the finalists, which we should try and adopt\n",
    "* Most of the finalists tend to stick with one model and really dive into it and explain it well\n",
    "    * Though some of the finalists did also do a lot of models and sometimes not explain it as well. They did usually through a lot of data science jargon and math at the reader so that might be what one them over. Not likely to be our tactic. \n",
    "* You also don't have to go super in depth about how the model performed or proving that the model is worth a damn. You can kinda just make a model and say \"Here it is, isn't it cool\".\n",
    "* I think having more \"Data Science-y\" and math is going to win over the judges for the metric track.\n",
    "* Applicability is completely useless for the main track. There is no real way to use these winning metrics, they are just cool.\n",
    "* Putting lots of words on your graphics and having lots of graphics in one picture is a solid way to cheat the cutoffs.\n",
    "* Having One __REALLY COOL__ concept in your submission is probably the way to go. If you hit on a really inventive and cool concept that is somewhat technical or interesting, you've probably landed a finalist spot\n",
    "*  Most of the top submissions didn't really touch on data cleaning or prep unless they did something very specific that is relevant to their model. (Dropping Play action, converting data to a different format, etc)\n",
    "* Doing the modeling on a __Frame Level__ is probably better than on a __play level__, since you get to plot something occuring during the course of the play.\n",
    "* A __Lot__ of the winning submissions had a plot of the players values chaning over the course of the play\n",
    "* They don't like when you arbitrarily choose something. Have as much stuff as you can be decided from the data"

    "* The project focus is stated clearly in the introduction.\n",
    "* The visualizations/animations were very well done\n",
    "* The metric is somewhat arbitrarily created and it had a limited link EPA.\n",
    "* It is unclear why it was important to attempt to use ML models to predict PoQIT using other columns – what does that add if you can calculate it exactly?\n",

    "* We didn't explain the math very well for either the intermediate steps or the full PoQIT calculation\n",
    "* The values we pull for different metrics like 3s or 2.5s for the dropoff aren't explained\n",
    "* The plots aren't directly related to what was discussed in the text, and therefore aren't explained very well\n",
    "* Comparison to EPA wasn't very clear or definitive\n",
    "* We ran our Models and shared the RSME, but didn't touch on if it was good or not.\n",
    "    * Not a lot of people shared the RSME for their models\n",
    "    * Also, the models weren't really clear as to why we ran them.\n",
    "* Not to be salty, but my quick Network Analysis was essentially the STRAIN paper done as a side project.\n",
    "* You could argue that it isn't terribly actionable. We essentially just show the top and bottom 5 teams by PoQIT.\n",
    "    * Counterpoint is that we did break down the feature importance to show how to increase/decrease the PoQIT and even wrote them out as prescriptive analytics.\n",
    "    * Also, it's not like STRAIN is terribly actionable. It basically just says who was good.\n",
    "* Side note: Most folks __Bolded the text for when you first introduce the metric__.\n",
    "* Steal the viz stuff from people that in the winners groups. They had really good animations and would help spruce up our submission\n",
    "* Really wondering if we should push to be in the coaches track for next year if possible. Seems like the data side of the competition is WAYY less competitive. Maybe Anthony's HS or College Coach? Maybe we cold call some coaches, idk.\n",
    "* We did do ours on a frame level for the model, then we aggregated it for the game and season level for the rest of the submission. I think being able to do a plot of the players most impactful on the poqit metric would've been nice. A __LOT__ of the winning submissions had a plot that was basically a plot of different players numbers changing over the course of the play.\n",
